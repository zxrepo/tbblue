P.D.    2019-01-04 - Core 2.00.24 
                     Sprites:   
                     Completely New Sprite Engine (128 total sprites,
                     100 sprites per line, 4bit colour sprites, sprite scaling
                     - four sizes: x1,x2,x4,x8 - Anchored sprites -allowing
                     relative movement of sprites together)
                     Video:
                     Two new Layer colour mix modes -SLU 110(U+L) clamped and
                     SLU 111 colour = (U+L)-5 - allowing for colour darkening and
                     brightening for backgrounds
                     Audio:
                     Each AY can now be made monophonic
                     Fixed AY modules so they're completely silent when volume
                     is 0
                     Z80N:
                     ED 28: BSLA DE,B (shift DE left by B places - uses bits 
                                       4..0 of B only)  
                     ED 29: BSRA DE,B (arithmetic shift right DE by B places 
                                       - uses bits 4..0 of B only)  
                     ED 2A: BSRL DE,B (logical shift right DE by B places 
                                       - uses bits 4..0 of B only)  
                     ED 2B: BSRF DE,B (shift right DE by B places, filling from 
                                       left with 1s - uses bits 4..0 of B only)  
                     ED 2C: BRLC DE,B (rotate DE left by B places  
                                       - uses bits 3..0 of B only)  
                     (to rotate right, use B=16-places)
                     ED 98 JP (C) -- PC[13:0] = IN (C) << 6

                     divMMC, beta priority L2 colour functions, Fixed DMA)
                     FW 1.10c
                     New SPREDIT
                     New Arkos 9 ch player dot command
