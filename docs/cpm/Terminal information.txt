NOTE: This information is taken directly from TERMINFO.COM which you can
      run by typing TERMINFO at the CP/M prompt.


ZX Spectrum Next BIOS Terminal Information
==========================================

This program provides information on the terminal facilities provided by the
BIOS on the ZX Spectrum Next.

On the ZX Spectrum Next, the EXTEND key functions as a control (CTRL) key,
so to press CTRL-S (for example), hold down the EXTEND key and press the S key.
You can also hold down CAPS SHIFT and SYMBOL SHIFT together, instead of EXTEND.

A few keys have special meanings to this program:

CTRL-A (Cursor left)   Reset the terminal and show the previous screen
CTRL-F (Cursor right)  Reset the terminal and show the next screen
CTRL-C                 Exit the program

Any other key pressed whilst this program is active will be sent directly to the
terminal, allowing you to type control codes or escape sequences and see the
effects that they have.

By default, the terminal provided is 24 lines by 80 columns, which is suitable
for most CP/M software. If desired you can change the terminal size using the
TERMSIZE.COM program to anything up to 32 lines by 80 columns.

Many CP/M applications need to be configured (via an INSTALL.COM program or
similar) so that they can control the terminal correctly. The ZX Spectrum Next
emulates most features of the Zenith Z-19 terminal, so choose one of the
following terminal types if possible:

       Zenith Z-19
       Heathkit H-19
       DEC VT52

Similar terminals or later models in the same series (eg Zenith Z-29, DEC VT100)
can also be tried.

If no suitable selection is available, you may need to manually specify the
features requested by the software. This program should help you determine what
control codes and escape sequences to use.

You can try out the codes in this program to better understand their effects.
For example, to try the sequence 

        ESC E 

(clear & home) press the BREAK key followed by a capital E. Pressing cursor left
or cursor right will always reset the terminal and change to the next/previous
screen.


Keyboard mappings
=================

The special keys provided by the ZX Spectrum Next are mapped as described here.
Some mappings are particularly helpful at the CP/M command line (or when
software uses the CP/M line editor), and these uses are also shown.

Special Key     Mapping         CP/M command line / line editor
-----------     -------         -------------------------------
BREAK                          ESC (can be used to type an escape sequence)
EDIT           CTRL-W          recall last command (if used at start of line)
TRUE VIDEO     CTRL-S          stop screen scrolling (CTRL-Q resumes scrolling)
INV. VIDEO     CTRL-I          TAB
CAPS LOCK                      Turns on/off caps lock (not passed to software)
GRAPH          CTRL-G          delete character under cursor
DELETE         CTRL-H          delete previous character
EXTEND         CTRL key
Cursor left    CTRL-A          left
Cursor right   CTRL-F          right
Cursor up      CTRL-E          start new line without submitting command
Cursor down    CTRL-X          delete to start of line

The keymappings may also be helpful in some software packages. For example,
in WordStar the cursor keys correspond to left & right by one word, and to
up & down by one line.


Terminal features
=================

The terminal displays characters using font files, which are in the standard
768-byte Spectrum character set format. You can replace these with your own
fonts if you wish. The files are:

       A:NORMAL.FNT    standard font
       A:UNDER.FNT     underlined font
       A:ITALIC.FNT    italicised font
       A:ITAL_UND.FNT  italicised & underlined font

The terminal responds to the following ASCII control characters, all of which
can be typed directly with the keyboard:

CTRL-G (GRAPH)         BEL (ASCII 7), alert/bell
CTRL-H (DELETE)        BS  (ASCII 8), backspace
CTRL-I (INV. VIDEO)    TAB (ASCII 9), tab
CTRL-J                 LF  (ASCII 10), line feed
CTRL-M (ENTER)         CR  (ASCII 13), carriage return
CTRL-X                 CAN (ASCII 24), cancel current escape sequence
       (BREAK)         ESC (ASCII 27), used to start escape sequences
       (CTRL-DELETE)   DEL (ASCII 127), delete forwards

Most terminal facilities are accessed using ESCape sequences.


Zenith Z-19 escape sequences
============================

The following Zenith Z-19 escape sequences are supported, many of which are
also common to the DEC VT52 and other terminals.

In the lists of sequences, ESC means the character code ASCII 27. The case of
letters is important. Note that sequences involving lower-case letters cannot
be directly typed at the command line because CP/M Plus automatically
converts all user input to upper case before executing it. To work around this
limitation, the ECHO.COM utility is provided.

Sequence       Effect
--------       ------
ESC @          enter insert mode
ESC A          cursor up
ESC B          cursor down
ESC C          cursor right
ESC D          cursor left
ESC E          clear & home screen
ESC H          cursor home
ESC I          reverse index (move cursor up, scrolling if necessary)
ESC J          erase from cursor to end of screen
ESC K          erase from cursor to end of line
ESC L          insert line
ESC M          delete line
ESC N          delete character under cursor
ESC O          leave insert mode

ESC Y l c      set cursor position to line l, column c (1,1 is top-left)
               (l and c are ASCII characters: add 32 to the desired value)
               eg to set cursor to line 1, column 50: ESC Y ! R

ESC b          erase from cursor to start of screen
ESC j          save cursor position
ESC k          restore cursor position
ESC l          erase entire line
ESC o          erase from cursor to start of line
ESC p          enter reverse video mode
ESC q          leave reverse video mode
ESC v          enable end-of-line wrapping
ESC w          disable end-of-line wrapping
ESC z          reset terminal to default modes


Additional +3 escape sequences
==============================

Some additional escape sequences used by Locomotive's version of CP/M for the
ZX Spectrum +3 are also supported. These are:

Sequence       Effect
--------       ------
ESC d          erase from cursor to start of screen
ESC e          enable cursor blob
ESC f          disable cursor blob
ESC r          enter underline mode
ESC u          leave underline mode


ZX Spectrum Next - specific escape sequences
============================================

The following additional escape sequences are specific to the ZX Spectrum Next:

Sequence        Effect
--------        ------

ESC S n         set background colour (n is an ASCII digit from '0' to '7')
                eg for a blue background: ESC S 1

ESC S R r g b   redefine current ZX background colour to the RGB value
                (r,g,b are ASCII digits from '0' to '7')
                eg redefine background colour to grey: ESC S R 1 1 1

ESC T n         set foreground colour (n is an ASCII digit from '0' to '7')
                eg for yellow text: ESC T 6
ESC T R r g b   redefine current ZX foreground colour to the RGB value
                (r,g,b are ASCII digits from '0' to '7')
                eg redefine foreground colour to orange: ESC S R 7 4 1

ESC U           enter italics mode
ESC V           leave italics mode
ESC W           make current colours the defaults, and 'wash' the screen


ANSI support
============

A number of ANSI sequences are also supported by the terminal. In these
sequences, 1 or 2 parameters may be provided, labeled 'n' and 'm'.

Such parameters are any sequence of ASCII digits 0 to 7, eg '23'. Parameters
are always optional and if not provided, a default of 0 is used (unless stated
otherwise).

ANSI compatibility mode
=======================

Some ANSI sequences clash with standard escape sequences provided with the
Zenith Z-19. If you have an application that requires the ANSI meaning for
these sequences, you can enter ANSI compatibility mode.

The following sequences enter or leave ANSI compatibility mode:

Sequence       Effect
--------       ------
ESC <          enter ANSI compatibility mode
ESC [ ? 2 h    leave ANSI compatibility mode

When in ANSI compatibility mode, these sequences have the following meanings:

Sequence       Effect
--------       ------
ESC D          move cursor down 1 line, scrolling if necessary
ESC E          move cursor to start of next line, scrolling if necessary
ESC M          move cursor up 1 line, scrolling if necessary
