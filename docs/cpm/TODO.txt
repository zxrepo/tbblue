ZX Spectrum Next CP/M BIOS TODOs
================================

1. Devices
----------
Currently there is no support for additional devices under CP/M on the ZX
Spectrum Next (only CRT is available).

In future releases of the BIOS, this will be addressed so that it is possible
to access some devices with drivers installed under NextZXOS, and additionally
raw access to the UARTs (for ESP8266 and Pi Zero etc).


2. Scripting
------------
The EXIT command (which uses USERF function 0 - exit CP/M) currently just
resets the Next.

In future releases of the BIOS, it is intended that this will return
gracefully to running process in NextZXOS (eg a running NextBASIC program).

There will also be support for passing an initial command line into CP/M.

These features will all CP/M commands (such as language compilers) to be
run under control of a NextBASIC or machine-code program.
