2019-09-24: 1.0 Initial Version

Users wishing to use esxDOS with their boards / cased ZX Spectrum Next computers
need to first download the 0.8.6b4 (minimum) (0.8.7 recommended) esxDOS 
distribution from  www.esxdos.org and then do the following under NextZXOS

1. Create two folders on the root folder named c:/bin/ and c:/sys/ by giving:
   mkdir "c:/bin"
   mkdir "c:/sys"

2. Using a PC or Mac, unzip the contents of the bin and sys folders into their 
   respective places.
3. Copy the esxmmc.bin into c:/machines/next
4. Edit the config.ini to add the esxmmc.bin switch into any Spectrum personali-
   ty in the distribution EXCEPT the Next personalities and the ZX80 and ZX81
   emulator personalities. Read the config.ini document elsewhere in this 
   distribution for the proper details of a menu line.

IMPORTANT NOTE regarding "dot" command compatibility
----------------------------------------------------
Note that NextZXOS has several dot commands that are newer than the ones
included with esxDOS so you may want to use these. Many of these work on
both systems. For esxDOS compliant versions, use the ones located under
c:/dot/extra.
