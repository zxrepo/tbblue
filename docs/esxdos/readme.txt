Users wishing to use esxDOS with their boards / cased ZX Spectrum Next computers
need to first download the 0.8.6 (minimum) esxDOS distribution from 
www.esxdos.org and then do the following under NextZXOS

1. Create two folders on the root folder named c:/bin/ and c:/sys/ by giving:
mkdir "c:/bin"
mkdir "c:/sys"

2. Using a PC, unzip the contents then
IMPORTANT: Copy the esxmmc.rom file into c:/tbblue/ and the contents of the bin 
and sys folders into their respective places.

Note that NextZXOS has several dot commands that are newer than the ones
included with esxDOS so you may want to use these. Many of these work on
both systems. For esxDOS compliant versions, use the ones located under
c:/dot/extra.
