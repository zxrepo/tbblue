NextZXOS Driver IDs
===================

Each NextZXOS driver has an ID in the range 0-127 (0x00-0x7F). A driver
normally requires a unique ID in order to distinguish it from others.

However, some types of driver (noted in the table with *) are generic. These
share the same interface at the DRIVER command (or M_DRVAPI & IDE_DRIVER calls)
but can support different external hardware.

For example, all printer drivers share the same driver ID "P". The user can
install the particular driver supporting their printer hardware interface, but
applications can use the "P" driver without needing to know which particular
printer interface driver has been installed. (Please see the example printer
driver in c:/src/asm/sample_prt).

Other generic driver classes may be added in future (for example, for MIDI
interfaces).

When writing a new driver, please request an ID from Garry Lancaster, via
Facebook or email (garrylancaster@gmail.com).

NOTE: ASCII letters are normally reserved for drivers that provide a streams
      & channels interface.
