@{c}@{h1}Menus

@{i}NextZXOS@{ui} is controlled using a set of menus, similar to those found on
original 128K Spectrums. When the machine is first booted, the main menu is
shown. Options menus for the @{i}NextBASIC@{ui} editor, @{i}Command Line@{ui} and @{i}Calculator@{ui}
can be brought up by pressing the @{b}EDIT@{ub} key during a session.

Within each menu, you can use the up/down cursor keys to move the highlight
bar to the desired option, and @{b}ENTER@{ub} to select the option. Pressing @{b}SPACE@{ub}
or @{b}BREAK@{ub} exits the current menu (or switches between the "@{i}main@{ui}" and "@{i}more@{ui}"
menus).

The left/right cursor keys can be used to change the speed at which programs
will be run, shown at the top of the menu.

Each menu option also has a @{i}shortcut@{ui} key shown in a different colour. Press
the indicated key to immediately execute the option. You can also press the
@{b}EXTEND@{ub} key to make the menu shortcuts more easily visible.

You can also control the menus using a joystick or controller, as long as it
is set up (in the firmware options) as a @{i}cursor@{ui}, @{i}Kempston 1@{ui} or @{i}MD 1@{ui} type.

The menu system is also @{"customisable" LINK MENUSCFG}, allowing you to tailor it to your
own requirements.

@{c}@{h1}Main Menu

@{h2}Browser
The @{i}Browser@{ui} allows you to explore the contents of your SD card and launch
programs. It has its own guide, available within it by pressing @{b}G@{ub}.

@{h2}Command Line
The @{i}Command Line@{ui} allows you to execute commands and see the results
immediately on-screen. It is mainly intended for running dot commands, but any
BASIC command can be entered. Press @{b}EDIT@{ub} to bring up its menu, allowing
you to exit back to the main menu or read its own guide.

@{h2}NextBASIC
The @{i}NextBASIC@{ui} editor allows you to enter, edit and run BASIC programs.
Press @{b}EDIT@{ub} to bring up its menu, allowing you to exit back to the main menu or
read its own guide.

@{h2}Calculator
The @{i}Calculator@{ui} allows you to enter quick calculations and see the results
immediately on-screen. Press @{b}EDIT@{ub} to bring up its menu, allowing you to exit
back to the main menu or read its own guide.

@{h2}Guide

@{c}@{h1}More Menu

@{h2}Tape Loader
Allows you to load cassette-based software. You can choose the type of Spectrum
the software is designed for, as well as additional options and controls. To
load cassette software, connect a @{i}Spectrum +3@{ui} cassette lead to the EAR/MIC
socket on the Next and connect the EAR cable at the other end to your
cassette player. If your cassette player has a stereo headphone socket, you
will need an adapter to convert the mono jack on the lead to a stereo jack.

@{h2}Tape Tester
If you have trouble loading cassette-based software, use this option to help
adjust the volume to an appropriate level. When the tape you wish to load is
playing, the coloured square on the volume indicator bar should move over
towards the right-hand side of the screen. Press @{b}SPACE@{ub} or @{b}BREAK@{ub} to exit.

@{h2}CP/M
@{i}CP/M@{ui} is a complete operating system for 8-bit computers with a huge amount
of software available. This option allows you to set up and run @{i}CP/M Plus@{ui} for
your Next. Further information can be found in @{i}c:/docs/cpm@{ui}.

@{h2}48K BASIC
Starts up your Next as if it was an original 48K Spectrum. Most NextZXOS
features are unavailable in this mode, but the @{"NMI menu" LINK NMIMENU} and some dot commands
can be used.

@{h2}128K BASIC
Starts up your Next as if it was an original 128K Spectrum. Most NextZXOS
features are unavailable in this mode, but the @{"NMI menu" LINK NMIMENU} can be used.

@{h2}ZX80 BASIC, ZX81 BASIC
Starts up your Next as if it was an original ZX80 or ZX81, using emulators
kindly provided by @{i}Paul Farrow@{ui}. Most NextZXOS features are unavailable
in this mode, but the @{"NMI menu" LINK NMIMENU} can be used. Further information can be
found at @{i}http://www.fruitcake.plus.com@{ui}.

@{h2}48K ROM cart
If you have a @{i}Sinclair Interface 2@{ui} (or clone such as the @{i}RAM Turbo@{ui}) attached
to your Next, this will start up any currently-inserted ROM cartridge.
@{b}WARNING:@{ub} Do not plug/unplug any interfaces or cartridges whilst the Next is
switched on.

@{h2}128K ROM cart
Similar to the previous option, but starts the cartridge with the Spectrum in
128K mode, needed to run 128K software that can be loaded on some custom ROM
cartridges (such as @{i}Paul Farrow@{ui}'s @{i}ZXC4@{ui}, or the @{i}ZX Dandanator@{ui}).

@{c}@{h1}NMI Menu

Pressing the yellow @{b}NMI@{ub} button on the side of the Next interrupts the
currently-running program and displays this menu. (Note that the speed shown in
this menu reflects whatever was running at the time the button was pressed. If
a NextZXOS menu or the editor was running, this will be 28MHz as the
operating system runs at the maximum speed when possible.)

Some options give access to the @{i}Browser@{ui} for saving or selecting files, but
please note that many @{i}Browser@{ui} features (such as directory sorting, file
copying etc) are not available when in the NMI. This is because any software
could currently be in control of the Next and these features could not
be used without risking overwriting memory being used by the software.

@{h2}Snapshot
Allows you to take a snapshot of the currently-running program in @{i}.Z80@{ui} format.
Note that this is only possible for 48K, 128K, ZX80 or ZX81 software.

@{h2}Screenshot
Gives access to a submenu allowing you to print or save the current screen or
palette. Note that only the selected layer can be saved/printed, and this will
not include any currently-visible sprites.

@{h2}TAP files
Provides options for changing the currently-selecting input and output @{i}.TAP@{ui} files.
This allows providing an output tape for saving game positions, or changing
the input tape for multi-load programs etc.

@{h2}POKEs
Allows selecting a file in the standard @{i}.POK@{ui} format to apply POKEs/cheats
to the currently-running game.

@{h2}Debug tools
Provides a submenu for examining or changing the state of the currently-running
software.

@{h2}Settings
Provides a submenu for examining or changing currently-selected hardware
options. Note that these are only changed temporarily and will be returned to
the defaults when the Next is reset.

@{h2}Keymap
Shows keyboard mappings for the current mode, kindly provided by @{i}Richard
Hallas@{ui}.

@{h2}About
Shows credits for contributors to NextZXOS.

@{c}@{h1}Configuration - autoexec.bas

You may wish to automatically start up your Next with your preferred options
(such as colour schemes, screensaver timeout, editor mode etc) or always run
the same software automatically at boot. This can be done simply by writing
a @{i}NextBASIC@{ui} program and saving it to auto-run as @{b}c:/nextzxos/autoexec.bas@{ub}.

Here is an example:
@{b}
        10 SPECTRUM SCREEN$ 0,1
        20 SPECTRUM CHR$ 85
        30 .editprefs --scheme dark
        40 .browseprefs --scheme dark
        50 PAPER 0:BORDER 0:INK 6
        60 ERASE
@{ub}

(the @{b}ERASE@{ub} command is used to automatically delete the program after it has
finished).

Save this using:
@{b}
        SAVE "c:/nextzxos/autoexec.bas" LINE 10
@{ub}

@{c}@{h1}Configuration - colour schemes

Various different @{i}Editor@{ui} colour schemes can be selected according to
your preferences. These affect the menu system as well as the @{i}NextBASIC@{ui@},
@{i}Command Line@{ui} and @{i}Calculator@{ui} editors. (Note that the @{i}Browser@{ui} has its own
independently-configurable colour schemes, which are detailed in its guide).

You can also create your own colour schemes. Most schemes provide different
colours for syntax-highlighting in the editors, although if you prefer you
can use a scheme without this (eg, the @{i}zx128@{ui} scheme).

The @{b}.EDITPREFS@{ub} dot command allows you to change to a predefined
colour scheme, or to a colour scheme loaded from a file. To see a list of the
predefined schemes, just type @{b}.EDITPREFS@{ub} at the command-line.

Select a predefined scheme with the @{i}--scheme@{ui} option. For example,
        @{b}.editprefs --scheme dark@{ub}
switches to a colour scheme with a dark background.

Select a scheme defined in a file (usually with the extension @{i}.ecs@{ui}) with
the @{i}--scheme-file@{ui} option. For example:
        @{b}.editprefs --scheme-file "c:/myschemes/vivid.ecs"@{ub}

These commands are suitable for adding to your @{b}autoexec.bas@{ub} file, so that
your preference is set every time the Next boots.

You can also change colour schemes from within the @{i}Browser@{ui} by selecting a
colour scheme file (with the @{i}.ecs@{ui} extension). Some samples are provided in
the @{b}c:/demos/Colour Schemes/Editor@{ub} directory.

@{h2}.ECS file format

If you wish to define your own colour scheme, you can create a @{i}.ecs@{ui} file.
This is a binary file (which could, for example be saved by @{b}SAVE..CODE@{ub}),
containing the following values:

@{i}Offset@{ui}  @{i}Data@{ui}
+0      attribute value: base colour scheme (background)
+1      attribute value: colour stripe black/red
+2      attribute value: colour stripe yellow/red
+3      attribute value: colour stripe yellow/green
+4      attribute value: colour stripe cyan/green
+5      attribute value: colour stripe cyan/black

@{r}NextZXOS Guide
@{c}@{h1}Configuration - menus

The menus shown by NextZXOS can be altered if you wish, using a simple
configuration file. This allows you to remove items that you never need, add
quick access to other things that you personally find useful, or simply
rearrange the items in the order that you prefer.

Menu configuration is controlled by the @{b}c:/nextzxos/enMenus.cfg@{ub} file. By
default this file is not present on your SD card, so NextZXOS uses its
own built-in menus.

An example configuration file is, however, provided. This is located on your
SD card as @{b}c:/nextzxos/enMenus-example.cfg@{ub}, and contains an exact
copy of the default menu system. You can therefore edit this file to your
requirements and rename it to @{b}c:/nextzxos/enMenus.cfg@{ub} in order to use
your own customised menus.

If you find that your menu is not working as expected, when you are in the main
menu you can hold down @{b}SYMBOL-SHIFT@{ub} and press @{b}SPACE@{ub} to reload
the standard built-in menu.

@{h2}Menu format
Each menu in the file consists of 3 or more lines.

The first line is simply an equals sign followed by the @{i}menu id@{ui}, a number
between 0 and 255.

The second line is the text shown in the title bar of the menu.

For example:
        @{b}=100@{ub}
        @{b}My Menu@{ub}

Each further line describes one of the options provided by the menu. There must
be between 1 and 10 such lines in each menu.

@{h2}Menu option line format
A menu option line consists of three sections: option name, action type and
action details. These are separated by colons @{b}:@{ub} (although the colon
between the action type and action details is optional). You can place an
underline character in the option name to indicate that the character before
the underline can be used as a @{i}shortcut@{ui} key to instantly select the
menu option.

        @{b}Type@{ub}    @{b}Action@{ub}                  @{b}Action details required@{ub}
        i       internal action         internal action id (a number, 0..255)
        m       switch menu             menu id (a number, 0..255)
        b       execute NextBASIC       NextBASIC code
        g       show guide              guide name

Some example lines for each type of action are:

        B_rowser:i:10
        Command Line:i2
        ZXZVM:b:cd"c:/games/Z-Machine/zxzvm":load"nxzxzvm.bas"
        NextGuide:gNextGuide

Note that the following characters inside NextBASIC code will be substituted:
  @{b}@{ub}  replaced by c:/nextzxos/
  @{b}`@{ub}  replaced by the current language code ("en" for English)

@{h2}Menu ids
The standard menu ids are listed below. You can include a menu with the same
id in your @{b}enMenus.cfg@{ub} file and it will override the standard menu. If you
don't include a particular menu in your file, the standard one will be used.

        @{b}Menu id@{ub}     @{b}Standard menu@{ub}
        0           Main menu
        1           "More" menu
        2           NextBASIC options menu
        3           Calculator options menu
        4           Command Line options menu

You can include as many other menus as you like, and link to them from other
menus using the @{i}m@{ui} action. Future versions of NextZXOS might add further menus,
so it is suggested using higher ids (eg 100+) for your own menus to avoid the
possibility of unexpectedly overriding a menu in a new version of NextZXOS.

@{h2}Internal actions
The following internal actions are available:

        @{b}Action id@{ub}   @{b}Internal function@{ub}
        0            Start NextBASIC editor
        1            Start Calculator
        2            Start Command Line
        3            Return to current editor (NextBASIC, Calculator
                                               or Command Line)
        4            Toggle between NextBASIC/Command Line
        5            Cycle between 32/64/85 column modes
        6            Toggle between upper/lower screen editing
        7            Renumber NextBASIC program
        8            Perform clear
        9            Exit from editors to main menu
        10           Start Browser
