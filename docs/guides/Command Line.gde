@{c}@{h1}Command Line Guide

The @{i}Command Line@{ui} is mainly intended for running file-related BASIC
commands (such as @{b}CAT@{ub}, @{b}ERASE@{ub}, @{b}COPY@{ub}, @{b}MOVE@{ub} etc) and @{i}dot commands@{ui},
but it can also be used to execute any other NextBASIC command.

For details on available commands, please see the @{b}ZX Spectrum
Next User Manual@{ub}. Further information (readable on PCs and Macs) can also
be found on this SD card in @{b}/docs/nextzxos@{ub}.

Available dot commands can be seen by typing:
        @{b}cat "c:/dot/"@{ub}

When entering a dot command, you must precede the name with a dot, eg:
        @{b}.mem@{ub}

Most dot commands require options and parameters, and usually provide their
own help. This is most often seen simply by typing the dot command without
any options, or with a @{b}-h@{ub} or @{b}--help@{ub} option. eg:
        @{b}.editprefs@{ub}
        @{b}.ls --help@{ub}

The command line editor shows various syntax items (dot commands, strings etc)
in different colours depending upon the currently-selected editor colour
scheme. For more information on editor colour schemes, see the @{b}NextZXOS@{ub} guide,
found on the main menu. Note that syntax-highlighting colours are currently
only supported for 32-character editing mode.

Pressing @{b}EDIT@{ub} brings up a @{"menu" LINK OPTIONS} for further options.
