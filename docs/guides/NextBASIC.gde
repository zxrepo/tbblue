This is a guide for the @{i}NextBASIC@{ui} editor. Information on BASIC commands
and functions may be added in the future. For now, please see the @{b}ZX Spectrum
Next User Manual@{ub}.

Further information (readable on PCs and Macs) can also be found on this SD
card in @{b}/docs/nextzxos@{ub}.

@{c}@{h1}The NextBASIC editor

The editor shows a partial listing of the current NextBASIC program on the
screen. You can move around the listing using the arrow keys (or the special
@{"editing keys" LINK EDITKEYS}, and modify or add program lines.

The program listing shows various syntax items (keywords, line numbers etc)
in different colours depending upon the currently-selected editor colour
scheme. For more information on editor colour schemes, see the @{b}NextZXOS@{ub} guide,
found on the main menu. Note that syntax-highlighting colours are currently
only supported for 32-character editing mode.

To add a new program line, move the cursor to a blank screen line (pressing
@{b}ENTER@{ub} will insert a new blank line for you after the current program line),
then type the line number followed by the commands (these are typed one letter
at a time, and do not use the "keyword" symbols shown on the Next's keyboard).

To enter a line into the program, press @{b}ENTER@{ub}. If the line is accepted
there will be an acknowledgement beep and the line will be reformatted and
displayed using the syntax-highlighting colours of the current colour scheme.
If there is an error on the line, a lower beep will sound and the cursor will
move to the location of the error so that you can correct it.

To delete an entire line, just type its number on a blank line and press
@{b}ENTER@{ub}. The line will then be removed from the listing.

To copy a line, edit its line number to a new number and press @{b}ENTER@{ub}. The
copy will be added with the new line number, leaving the original line intact.

You can also run commands directly from the NextBASIC editor. To do this,
simply enter the required commands without a preceding line number.

Pressing @{b}EDIT@{ub} brings up a @{"menu" LINK OPTIONS} for further options.

@{c}@{h1}Edit options menu

The options menu provides further available actions.

@{h2}NextBASIC
Dismisses the options menu and returns to the NextBASIC editor.

@{h2}Command Line
Switches to the @{i}Command Line@{ui}.

@{h2}32/64/85
Cycles between 32/64/85 columns-per-line mode, allowing different amounts of
information to be shown on screen. Note that syntax highlighting is currently
only available in 32-column mode.

@{h2}Screen
Switches between editing the program in the main screen or in the bottom 2
lines of the screen only. Editing in the bottom 2 lines can be useful if you
want to be able to edit your program whilst keeping the output from its last
run visible in the main screen. This option can also be toggled by pressing
@{b}EXTEND@{ub} and then @{b}EDIT@{ub}.

@{h2}Renumber
Renumbers the program. Lines will be renumbered in steps of 10, starting at 10.
For more control over renumbering, you can use the NextBASIC @{b}LINE@{ub} command.

@{h2}Clear
If you are running very short of memory, attempting to enter a line may fail.
This option performs a @{b}CLEAR 65367@{ub} command to free up as much memory as
possible.

@{h2}Guide
Brings up this guide.

@{h2}Exit
Exits the editor and returns to the main NextZXOS menu.
