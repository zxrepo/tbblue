@{c}@{h1}Calculator Guide

The @{i}Calculator@{ui} allows you to quickly and easily perform calculations.

You can enter any numeric (floating-point or integer) expression. This may be
as simple as just 2 numbers and an operator, or as complex as you like, using
any NextBASIC functions and variables.

eg:@{b}
        3*9
        sin (pi/4)
        %a(1)<<2
@{ub}

When you press @{b}ENTER@{ub} the expression is evaluated and the answer is
displayed on the following line. You can use the answer in a further expression
by typing directly after it. Alternatively, press @{b}ENTER@{ub} to start a
new line and begin entering a new expression.

Pressing @{b}EDIT@{ub} brings up a @{"menu" LINK OPTIONS} for further options.
