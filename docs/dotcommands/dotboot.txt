.boot by David Saphier / emook 2019

.boot will allow you to switch personalities from NextZXOS or esxdos.

Usage .boot or .boot [n] n=mode

Running .boot on its own will read your current config.ini and list
on screen allowing you to pick the mode you want to reboot in to.

This rewrites your config.ini, so always have a backup.

place the file inside c:\dot\ and c:\bin\

Enjoy!
