Introduction
============
Configuration of your ZX Spectrum Next computer can be done in two ways:
1 a. Via the Boot Screen (by pressing <SPACEBAR> while booting and then entering 
     the Editor Module with "E")
  b. Automatically upon boot specifically for the screen detection/adjustment
2. Via the config.ini file

The second method provides access to some settings not found on the regular ZX 
Spectrum Next Editor Module, adding a machine personality, changing the machine
type for said personality, provide alternate ROM images and even more 
importantly setting your monitor if it doesn't work out of the box.
Config.ini is a regular text file, located in the c:/machines/next/ folder of 
your boot SD Card and it's read upon first boot after an F1 reset or cold boot.

Config.ini groups
=================
There are two basic groups of settings in the config.ini each one with it's own
sections/parts:
1. The global settings; or settings that apply to ALL the machine personalities
-and-
2. The per-personality settings (which also double as singular menu entries for 
each personality you setup)

Global Settings
===============
Global settings are set one-per-line with each setting's name followed by an '='
sign follwed by the value of the setting

Note: Starting with FW version 1.10b, if you modify the config.ini and enter 
non-acceptable values for each setting, the FW upon boot will replace these
values with the smallest acceptable one.

These are:
1. scandoubler
This sets the scandoubler ON (1) or OFF (0). 
Scandoubler must be ON for VGA displays and OFF for RGB type monitors (or SCART
connections). It changes the horizontal scanrate from 30kHz (VGA) to 15KHz
(RGB). If you're using a  PS/2 keyboard this setting can also be changed on the 
fly by pressing F2 otherwise on a Spectrum membrane keyboard you'll need to 
press NMI (on the side of the machine) + 2. This function key responds differently
on digital displays as it forces a resync.

Default setting:
scandoubler=1


2.50_60hz 
This sets the main frequency of the display to 50Hz(0) or 60Hz(1). 
60Hz should be avoided whenever possible and as a setting it is only there for 
those whose displays cannot work below 60Hz (usually monitors specifically made 
for PCs). 50Hz retains the proper frame rate for Spectrum software and software
that requires very strict timings so it's advisable you always use that.
If you're using a PS/2 keyboard this setting can also be changed on the fly by 
pressing F3 (or NMI+3)

Default setting:
50_60hz=1


3. timex 
This enables Timex modes (HiRes and Multicolour) if set to (1)

Default setting:
timex=1


4.psgmode
psgmode sets the on board PSG mode to AY (0), YM (1), reserved (2) and disabled
(3).
Noe: To truly disable AY the port addresses should be disabled and reset will 
silence it (See relavant NextREG documentation)

Default setting:
psgmode=0


5.stereomode
stereomode changes the stereophonic (Left-Center-Right) ordering of the PSG 
channels from ABC (0) to ACB (1)

Default setting:
stereomode=1


6.intsnd

Intsnd enables (1) or disables (0) the internal beeper.

Default setting:
intsnd=1


7.turbosound
Turbosound disables(0) or enables(1) the additional 2 AYs to give you either an 
option of 3 or 9 channels of PSG audio

Default setting:
turbosound=1


8.covox
This setting enables (1) or disables (0) ALL onboard SpecDRUM / Covox 
Soundrive compatible DAC hardware. Individual DAC hardware can be selectively
disabled/enabled by the relevant NextREG. See the NextREG documentation for
details.

Default setting:
covox=1


9.divmmc
This enables (1) or disables (0) the onboard divMMC. This won't affect boot but
will make the divMMC hardware unavailable to the selected personality. If this 
is enabled, then *if* the setting is *NOT* overriden by the per-personality 
settings as outlined in the following section, then a ROM image file named 
esxmmc.bin is expected to be located in c:/machines/next/.

Default setting:
divmmc=0


10.divports
This enables(1) access to the DivMMC i/o ports. For the +3e personality to 
operate properly, this needs to be set, as it needs access to these ports even 
though the DivMMC ROM is not loaded/used. 

Default setting:
divports=1


11. mf
This enables (1) or disables (0) the onboard MF-compatible hardware. It, too can
be overridden by the per-personality setting as outlined in the following 
section. If it is however enabled and the ROM filename is NOT overriden, then it
can be one of the following according to selected machine type. If machine type 
is 0 (48K) then the rom filename expected is mf.rom, if machine type is 1 (128K)
then the rom filename expected is mf128.rom and if it's 2 (+2/+3) then the 
expected rom filename is mf3.rom. These rom image files must be user provided 
and then placed in the c:/machines/next/ folder.

Default setting:
mf=0


12. joystick1
joystick1 (and joystick2 that follows) sets the first port joystick type to one
of the following options: 
0 = Sinclair 2 (67890)
1 = Kempston 1 (port 0x1F)
2 = Cursor (56780)
3 = Sinclair 1 (12345)
4 = Kempston 2 (port 0x37)
5 = MD 1 (3 or 6 button joystick port 0x1F)
-or-
6 = MD 2 (3 or 6 button joystick port 0x37)


Default setting:
joystick1=2


13. joystick2
This setting is as the previous one and accepts the same options (some of which 
are mutually exclusive i.e. if you select a Kempston 1 for joystick1 you cannot 
select a Kempston 1 for the second port as well)

Default setting:
joystick2=0


14. ps2
This setting rewires internally the PS/2 port to have the mouse connector as 
first PS/2 device(1) rather than the default which is keyboard(0). This 
facilitates plugging in a PS/2 mouse without a Y-splitter cable if you already 
have a membrane keyboard attached or a regular cased Next.

Default setting:
ps2=0 (cased next)
ps2=1 (board backers' distribution)


15. scanlines
This setting produces a cosmetic scanline-like effect of variable intensity from
totally disabled (0), to 50% (1), 25% (2) and 12.5% (3).
Scanlines are also controlled on the fly with the F7 key on the PS/2 keyboard 
(or NMI+7)

Default setting:
scanlines=0


16. dac
The dac setting only applies to the Vtrucco development board and can be safely 
disregarded as it doesn't apply to the ZX Spectrum Next. It has nothing to do
with the actual DACs on the ZX Spectrum Next which are controlled by the covox
setting above.

Default setting:
dac=0


17. turbokey
turbokey, enables(1) or disables (0) access to speeds over the standard 3.58Mhz.
If enabled, speed can be also overriden on the fly with the F8 key on a PS/2 
keyboard (or NMI+8)

Default setting:
turbokey=1


18. timing
timing sets a global screenmode setting from 0..7 for all menu items that have a
screen mode set to 8 and it's set automatically from the new testcard video
setting module upon boot. If a menu item contains a video mode different from 
8 then this setting is overridden. An express setting of timing=8 forces the
appearance of the TestCard.

Default setting (new distribution):
timing=8


19. default
this setting bridges the global configuration section with the per-personality 
configuration section/menu and selects which of the machine personalities that 
follow will be the one that boots by default. Entries are 0-based so the default
(0) actually means the 1st entry in the list

Default setting:
default=0


20. dma
This setting enables(1) or disables (0) the onboard DMA controller. 
The controller type is determined by which port is accessed and can be either 
Z80DMA or ZXNDMA. See the NextREG and zxnDMA documentation for details.

default=0


21. keyb_issue
This setting enables Issue 2 (1) keyboard emulation or selects the default 
Issue 3 (0). Only applies to very old software.

default=0


22. ay48
This setting enables (1) or disables  (0) the presence of the base (128K style)
AY chip while in 48K mode. This is needed for certain programs that identify 
erroneously a 48K personality as 128K.

default=0


23. uart_i2c
This setting enables (1) or disables (0) the I2C and UART devices

default=1


24. kmouse
This setting enables (1) or disables (1) the Kempston Mouse.
default=1


25. ulaplus
This setting enables (1) or disables (0) support for the ULA+ ULA extensions

default=1


26. hdmisound
This settings enables (1) or disables (0) sound output from the digital video
port. Sound is still being output by the audio out jack in the back.

default=1


27. beepmode
This setting disables (1) or enables (0) mixing of the beeper channel in the 
audio stream output. If set to disabled, beeper audio will only come from the 
internal speaker.

default=0


Per-Personality Settings
========================
The per-personality settings group serves three functions:
1. Create a boot menu entry per-line
2. Describe each machine personality's type as well as the display that's 
   connected to it
3. Override -if required- some global settings specifically for that personality

You will need one line starting with "menu=" per-personality up to a maximum of 
15 lines as follows:

menu="Name of machine",Type,Display,Main_ROM_Image_File,
      divMMC_ROM_Image_File,MF_ROM_Image_File

"Name of machine" is a meaninful name describing what this machine-personality 
                  is. 
                  Note: Make sure that the name is 32 characters long or shorter
                  as specifically for the Boot menu/Editor modules only standard
                  Spectrum resolution and fonts are supported.

e.g. ZX Spectrum 128K UK

Type can be one of the following: 0 (48K Spectrum), 
                                  1 (128K/+2 -grey- Spectrum), 
                                  2 (+2A/+3/Next), 
                                  3 (Soviet clone-style timings 128K Spectrum)
                                  
The machine type controls what roms are loaded (so it will prevent paging in 
non-existent roms via ports 7ffd, 1ffd) and which multiface model is implemented

Display can be a number from 0 to 6 for VGA or 7 for Digital. This takes as a 
base the 50_60hz setting in the Global settings group and modifies the sync 
frequency in steps of approximately 1Hz to facilitate screen "lock" according to
your monitor. As the number is increased, the realtime speed of the machine 
increases with frame rates rising with it toward a rate VGA monitors may be able
to accept.  The relative timings of all the hardware remains intact so that the
machine will continue to generate a correct display with the spectrum's original
video frame.. Setting 7 (Digital) completely modifies the timings to make the 
display compatible with modern HDMI/DVI monitors as well as changing the aspect 
ratio and border size (Especially for the 60Hz Digital setting 7). 
Many HDMI/DVI monitors will work with a setting of 0 to 6 however ALL HDMI/DVI
monitors will work with a setting of 7.
A setting of 8 allows the video testing boot module to set the screen according
to the user's input during boot (See timing setting above)

Main_ROM_Image_File is a ROM image file that's appropriate for the machine type
you've selected in the previous setting e.g. 48.rom for a standard 48K ZX 
Spectrum and which MUST be located in c:/machines/next/.

divMMC_ROM_Image_File. If this is set, then the global divMMC setting is 
overriden and the filename defined is used in lieu of the default esxmmc.bin. 
This rom image file is also expected to be found in c:/machines/next/ and lastly,

MF_ROM_Image_File, if this is set then the Global configuration for MF hardware 
is overriden, the hardware is enabled and the rom image file used is the one you
specify. This file should also be located in c:/machines/next/


e.g. menu=ZX Spectrum 128K,1,7,128Kalt.rom 
will add a boot menu entry that's enabling the 128K toastrack type with a bug 
fixed rom named 128Kal.rom and Digital display type. If divMMC is enabled in 
global settings this will require the presence of an esxDOS rom and if MF is 
enabled then it will require the presence of MF128.ROM
