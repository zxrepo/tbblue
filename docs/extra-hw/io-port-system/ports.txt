The TBBlue uses two I/O ports on the register/data system, to send and read information about hardware and settings.

Port 0x243B (9275) is write-only and is used to set the registry number, listed below.

Port 0x253B (9531) is used to access the registry value, the registry being either only a few bits or allÂ bits only read, write or read/write, depending on the registry number set.

Some registers are accessible only during the initialization process (IPL and modules).

Registers:
