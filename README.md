Contributor Requests
====================
If you wish to contribute to the distribution, a request via gitlab is not 
the only step you need to take; you need to get in touch with one of the other
contributors and describe the nature of your planned contribution.  
This is a necessary step as this is the **official** distribution and legality / licenses
**MUST** be strictly observed.
