     Title: Zombies
     Author:  ANONYMOUS
     Another Z-Abuse, extremely similar to Robots--the goal is to get the ASCII characters that are chasing you (here they're Zs) to bump into other ASCII characters (Os) because Os kill Zs, it seems. Apparently, this is a port of an old BASIC game.

     Title: Super Z Trek
     Author:  John Menichelli, Chris Nystrom, David Ahl, Mike Mayfield, and Bob Leedom
     Another Z-Abuse, this one of the game Super Star Trek--originally written by Mike Mayfield in BASIC and published by Dave Ahl in his book of BASIC programs, with contributions from Bob Leedom. Chris Nystrom ported it to C, and John Menichelli did this port. Basically, you pilot the Enterprise around killing Klingons and refueling; it certainly doesn't lose anything in the Z-machine medium, though it's not inherently thrilling.

     Title: Zugzwang
     Author: Magnus Olsson
     Out of the TextFire "12-pack", this is an April's Fool game "demo" in which you get to play a pawn in a chess game - at the very end. Incorporates a very nifty variation on the status line to show the positions of the chess pieces after each move.
