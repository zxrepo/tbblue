ZXZVM for the ZX Spectrum Next
==============================

ZXZVM is a Z-Machine emulator written by John Elliott (for the Spectrum +3
and PCW machines) and ported to the ZX Spectrum Next by Garry Lancaster.

It allows you to play text adventure games written for the Z-Machine.

This includes classic games from Infocom, such as Zork and Planetfall, as
well as hundreds of newer games written between 1993 and the present day
(mostly using Graham Nelson's Inform compiler).

Some games can be found in C:/games/Z-Machine on your Next's SD card. The
definitive source for Z-Machine games on the internet is:

        https://www.ifarchive.org/

ZXZVM can play version 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 games (these should be given filenames
ending with .z3 .z4 .z5 .z7 or .z8 in order to be recognised by the Browser).

You can play games simply by selecting them in the Browser, and ZXZVM will
automatically be launched. Alternatively, you can run ZXZVM directly by
selecting NXZXZVM.BAS in the C:/games/Z-Machine/zxzvm directory.

The full source code for ZXZVM can be found on your Next's SD card in the
C:/src/asm/zxzvm directory, and also at:
        https://gitlab.com/garrylancaster/zxzvm


Customising ZXZVM
=================
You can customise ZXZVM in a few ways to suit your tastes. To do this, first
BREAK into the program just after loading NXZXZVM.BAS from the Browser.

In the NextBASIC editor, examine the setup() procedure to see what can be
modified (this begins with the line DEFPROC setup() near the start of the
program). Currently you can change:

  * the default colours

  * the offset and size of the display, relative to the edge of the screen
    (this may be useful if your monitor is unable to display the full width
    or height)
    The maximum size is 80 chars x 32 lines, and the program is supplied with
    a default of 80 x 28, which should be usable with most monitors

  * the printer (or other device) to which transcript output will be sent
    (in most Infocom games, the transcript is turned on with the SCRIPT
    command)

When you are satisfied, save the program with:
    SAVE "nxzxzvm.bas" LINE 730

Please check the last few lines of the program in case this has changed due
to renumbering. The line number to use in your SAVE command is the one
that reads:
        730 CLEAR %$67ff


Fonts
=====
Additionally, you can replace the default fonts used by ZXZVM. The fonts/
subdirectory contains the following files which ZXZVM loads in:

  * normal.fnt          Main font (96 chars, standard 768-byte Spectrum format)
  * accent.fnt          Accented characters (69 chars)
  * emphasis.fnt        Emphasis font (should be underlined or italicised)
  * accentem.fnt        Emphasis font for accented characters
  * font3.fnt           Character graphics font (should not be changed)
  * font3em.fnt         Emphasized char. graphics font (should not be changed)

The normal.fnt, accent.fnt, emphasis.fnt, and accentem.fnt files may be
replaced to suit your tastes. To aid in this a couple of alternatives are
provided - just rename these to the appropriate font name:

  * underline.fnt         A replacement for emphasis.fnt, using underlining
  * italic.fnt            The default file for emphasis.fnt, using italics
  * accent_underline.fnt  A replacement for accentem.fnt, using underlining
  * accent_italic.fnt     The default file for accentem.fnt, using italics

Also supplied is the following BASIC program:

  * fontgen.bas

This program allows you to provide a standard 768-byte Spectrum character set
font (named input.fnt) and, optionally, a 69-character accents font (named
inputacc.fnt). It can generate an accented character set (if you don't wish to
provide your own) and it can generate emphasis fonts using underlining or
italicising. Full instructions are provided when you run the program.

Thanks to Hugo Labrande for providing improved versions of the default
accented fonts.
