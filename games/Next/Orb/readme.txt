ORB RUN

This is a game I wrote during the ToJam game jam event in Toronto, 2018.  The
theme of the jam is "Winners are Losers", so I took that to mean there is no winning state.

When I was a child, I typed in a game from a magazine for my ZX81.  This game was called "Magic Dollar Seeds" and was written by Paul Holmes.  The BASIC listing was published in the Oct/Nov 1982 issue of ZX Computing and can be found at the following URL:

I decided at the game jam to attempt to write a whole game in NextBASIC on my ZX Spectrum Next.  

You play Rotox, a little robot who needs to move around the grid avoiding the holes into the void.  Walking into a hole will end the game.  Every time Rotox moves he leaves behind an orb seed, and up to two holes will appear horizontally or vertically next to his new position.  If Rotox moves back on to an orb seed, he consumes the seed to generate 4 power orbs around him.  The creation of these power orbs will remove any void holes around him.  Moving on to a power orb will give you 1 power point.  If you find yourself stuck, you can hit fire and spend 4 power points to remove the void holes around you.  If you don't have enough power points, well then sorry.

Keys are Q=Up, A=Down, O=Left, P=Right and M or SPACE to fire.

Good luck!
