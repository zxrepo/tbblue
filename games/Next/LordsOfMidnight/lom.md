# Lords of Midnight (Next version)

This game is a faithful update of the original game Lords of Midnight to take
advantage of the Next's graphics mode.  The game is identical to the original
except for a few touches:

* Select screen identifies which characters have reached night.
* New help/credit screen reached by pressing H.
* Support for SD card game saves instead of cassette.
* Cursor keys are supported for looking around.
* Updated graphics.

## License

This game was developed under licence from <http://www.thelordsofmidnight.com>

## Instructions

The original manual can be found at:

<http://icemark.com/tower/manual/contents.htm>

I recommend that you read it first before commencing your first game.

The original game came with an overlay that shows what the controls are.
On this version the controls are slightly different and can be shown at any time
by pressing H.  This will show the help/credit screen and list the key and 
their commands.
