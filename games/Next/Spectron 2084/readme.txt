Spectron 2084 is a classic golden age arcade game for the ZX Spectrum Next, with a focus on faithfulness to the arcade version, as well as control flexibility. All controls modes will be available: Single sticks, twin sticks, 

Here I present a runnable teaser of the attract screen. No playability yet, but you should get a sense of how faithfulness to the arcade version the game will be.

Best viewed on the Next Issue 2A board, using NextOS distribution V.0.8B-REV.A or any later version - available from the link below. Please re-run the update procedure if you have any problems running this demo, or contact me by email. This demo isn't supported on the ZEsarUX or CSpect emulators.
