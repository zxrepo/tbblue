This directory (C:/NEXTZXOS/CPM) should contain essential CP/M system files.

They can be downloaded from "The Unoffical CP/M Web site" which is officially
licensed to distribute them.

Please download the following file and extract its contents into this
directory:

        http://www.cpm.z80.de/download/cpm3bin_unix.zip

Once the files are present here and you have the latest CPMBASE.P3D in the
C:/NEXTZXOS directory, choose "CP/M" from the main menu and the system will
automatically be set up.
