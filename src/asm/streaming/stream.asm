; Next, obtain the map of card addresses for the file.
; Note that this call (DISK_FILEMAP) should be made directly after opening the
; file - no other file access calls should be made first.
; (If the file has been accessed, the filepointer should be reset to the start
; using F_SEEK, and a single byte read (with F_READ) before making this call.
; This will ensure that the current sector information maintained by the OS
; is correctly pointing to the first sector of the file.)
;
; A buffer must be provided to hold the card addresses.
;
; Each entry in the buffer occupies 6 bytes and describes an area of the
; file which can be anywhere between 2K and 32MB in size (depending on the
; way the card was formatted, and how fragmented the file is).
; Therefore, it is possible to calculate the absolute maximum number of buffer
; entries required by dividing the size of the file by 2K.
;
; It is also possible to use a smaller buffer and call disk_filemap multiple
; times when a refill is required (provided the last streaming operation has
; been stopped before the next disk_filemap call is made).
;
; Often, files are unfragmented, and so will use only 1 entry. You could
; potentially write your code to assume this (which would therefore be simpler
; than this example), and cause an error if more than 1 entry is returned,
; citing "framentation" and suggesting the user run the .defrag dot command
; on the file. (Note that some CompactFlash, and other IDE, may be limited
; to a maximum section size of 64K).
;
; The byte/block addressing flag returned in bit 1 of A may be useful if you
; wish to start streaming data from a particular 512-byte block offset within
; the file, as it indicates how to adjust the 4-byte card addresses:
;   if bit 1 of A=0, then add 512 to the card address for every block
;   if bit 1 of A=1, then add 1 to the card address for every block

refill_map:

;                bit 1=0 for byte addressing, 1 for block addressing

        ld      (cardflags),a           ; store card flags for later use

; Now we can enter a loop to stream data from each entry in the buffer.

        ld      b,(hl)                  ; BC=number of 512-byte blocks
        inc     hl
        push    hl                      ; save updated buffer address
        push    bc                      ; save number of blocks

; Streaming is initiated by calling DISK_STRMSTART with:
;       IXDE=card address
;       BC=number of 512-byte blocks to stream
;       A=card flags, as returned by DISK_FILEMAP
; After this call is issued it is important that no further esxDOS calls
; (or NextZXOS calls which might access a filesystem) are issued until the
; matching DISK_STRMEND call has been made.
; It is also important to ensure that the Multiface (which could access files)
; is disabled for the duration of the streaming operation. (Done earlier in
; this example).

; NOTE: From NextZXOS v2.01, you can optionally set bit 7 of A to indicate
;       that DISK_STRMSTART should not wait for the data from the card to
;       be ready to stream. This allows the user to do some other work first
;       to cover the latency and later manually check that the data is ready.
;       If you set this bit (and if the protocol is SD/MMC), before reading
;       any data you must first wait for the data token ($fe) to be received:
;       the required code is the same as at the later "wait_token" routine.

        ld      a,(cardflags)           ; A=card flags
        rst     $8

        jr      c,drop2_close_and_exit_with_error

; If successful, the call returns with:
;       B=protocol: 0=SD/MMC, 1=IDE
;       C=data port
; NOTE: On the Next, these values will always be:
;       B=0
;       C=$EB
; Therefore, your code code be slightly faster and simpler if writing a
; Next-only program. However, these values are provided to allow portable
; streaming code to be written (if NextZXOS is later ported to other platforms).
