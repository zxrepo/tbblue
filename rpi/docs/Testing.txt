IF YOU ARE TESTING.

Burn to 1Gb or larger SD card,
Use included pi.bas to route your UART to the Pi, and open .uart (by Tim, on the distro)

Connect at 115,200.

You should see the pi booting, if not hit enter a few times. Does it say â€œSUP> â€œ?

Try running `nextpi-admin_enable` 
   Did it change to â€œSUP# â€œ?

If so, run `nextpi-admin_disable`
   Quickly, before you break something ðŸ™‚ you just disabled all checking and prepared the pi for an upgrade ðŸ˜€

If you want to keep your work, between upgrades, I suggest you make use of the persistent userland partiton (in the docs) and copy them off between upgrades, it should mount on any windows or Mac, itâ€™s formatted FAT16 especially to make migrations easier for you.
