 * Added support for Lua(5.1) CLI, and the Lua compiler

 * Added libao-common, libao4

 * Added nextpi-play_sndh, and dependancies

 * Swapped wrapCD with porg - all custom packages now use porg, see https://github.com/StalePixels/csid-mod/tree/master/NextPi and https://github.com/StalePixels/sc68/tree/master/NextPi for examples of the CI/CD hooks required for your own package integration - proper documentation will follow

 * Added missing bits to Changelog

 * Added a /nextpi folder in the root of the Dongle to the search path, for persistent CLIs on a dongle :D (/mnt/dongle/nextpi)

 * Added the first round of the func helpers, this handles compulsory URLs, and routes people to the wiki for help. Virtually wiki pages yet exist :D

 * Added /BAS to distro tar

 * Fixed a bug in "nextpi-admin_clean --update" where it was logging dongle space to distro files

Things that DID change since Alpha 0.89

        ssh includes a number of preinstalled keys used for potential updates, please do not remove

Version 0.89 DietPi for Next - The Last Alpha? ðŸš¨

If you have been following the old version number scheme this "would have been" Alpha9 :)

Things that DID NOT change since Alpha8

 * We're still on Rasbian Stretch, and that is here to stay, the number of changes we would need to make to Rasbian Buster to make it fit with our constraints don't align with the time we have, or the resources we can burn, before Gold Master is due to SMS. Sorry.

Things that DID change since Alpha 9

 * Bluetooth is back, now routed via the MiniUART, but the software stack is missing -- this means that our image doesn't stop someone using the bluetooth module independently if they put in a Pi0w, but we've not using space for the software.

 * FileSystem is now READ ONLY - use the nextpi-admin_* tools to manage this

 * nextpi-* tools are overridable via RAM, or persistent via the internal user persistence 

 * Dedicated /ram volatile drive exposed for NextPi use -- will be wiped every reboot
 
 * I2S Sound(!!) - PWM sound now disabled, swapped for new DAC, managed via DTO

 * SUPervisor reflects FS admin status - SUP> is RO, SUP# is RW

 * .bashrc for root, and SUPervisor now includes nextpi-* for default, persistent, and temp
