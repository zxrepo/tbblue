Things that are different to "normal linux"

The File system is READ ONLY
There's no RTC, and no network, so we're trapped in no-time, immortal.
Because there's no passage of time, there's no CRON.

DO NOT update packages via apt - this will overwrite custom configs, and probably stop the device booting.
