Partition Layout

The main SD card image is split into three sections

Device      Start     End Sectors  Size Id Type
NextPi_1)    8192   98045   89854 43.9M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
NextPi_2)   98304 1880063 1781760  870M 83 Linux
NextPi_3) 1880064 1966079   86016   42M  e W95 FAT16 (LBA)

1) /boot                    -- DietPi defaults and system files
2) /                        -- EXT4 master filesystem, read only
3) /mnt/nextpiuser_internal -- User read write, aliased to /NextPi

Partitions are managed via UUIDs to prevent USB devices from preventing boot.

Partition 2 is mount RO, and is the System ROM -- this can only be edited after enabling RW mode with nextpi-admin_enable
Partition 3 is bound (mount -o bind) to /NextPi for easier system management and system emulation, later, for developers. This is the Persistent partition.

/ram is also a 240M RAM drive, volatile, so lost between power cycles.
