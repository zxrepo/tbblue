# Take a stream of data on stdin, uudecode, and eject on stdout

#   encode with:
#		uuencode -m < AFILE.BIN ReferenceName.ext > AFILE.UUE
#
#   If the archive is decoded with nextpi-file_receive it will use the
#	"ReferenceName.ext" when created on disc. 
#
#   nextpi-file_stream does not use the ReferenceName.ext, as it emits
#	bytes on stdout instead
# 
#  Resultant AFILE.UUE is the file you would include in your nextbundle
#   and is the file you should send over the UART.
