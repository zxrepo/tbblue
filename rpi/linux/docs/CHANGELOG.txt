 * Added MD5 sums to builds assets for SMS validation

 * Fixed bug in df-h generation that was accidentally logging size of currently attached PlusPacks and mounted memory

Things that NOTDID change since Beta 0.98
 * Removed private test files, ready for GM - these will now live in the Media PlusPack
 * nextpi-admin_clean now defaults to RAM cleaner, all other options behind flags
 * nextpi-play_silence for when you kill a player, and want to send NULL to the DAC (this is a hack. to be patched post GM)
 * NextPi now writes the "last known localtime" to /boot on shutdown, allowing you to set the clock at startup by editing this file, or store the last "known time" or network time if Ethernet found
 * Removed Terminex.nex, to prevent confusion
 * Updated Terminex.snx, now handles "much bigger files", and uses nextpi-file_stream system method to base64 decode the results. Thanks David Saphier/emook!

Things that NOTDID change since Beta 0.97
 * PlusPack builder now does nexted zips in nexted zips, so you need less diskspace to extract and select pluspacks

 * Added nextpi-plus_activate, nextpi-plus_list, nextpi_plus-unlock and nextpi-plus_lock
 * nextpi-plus_list called upon SUPervisor startup

 * Added support for autoexec.sh in "nextpi" folder on all persistant and Plus Pack storage areas
 * Added ntpdate (not ntpd)
    _IF_ you have an Ethernet dongle on your PiZero NextPi will try to update the softclock on "Last known good time" GMT

Things that DIDNOT change since Alpha 0.95
 * Added /opt/nextpi/EDITION for reporting size, and other features of active image (eg 1RO, 1GB, Read Only ROOT)

Version 0.89 DietPi for Next - The Last Alpha? üö®

If you have been following the old version number scheme this "would have been" Alpha9 :)

Things that DID NOT change since Alpha8

 * We're still on Rasbian Stretch, and that is here to stay, the number of changes we would need to make to Rasbian Buster to make it fit with our constraints don't align with the time we have, or the resources we can burn, before Gold Master is due to SMS. Sorry.

Things that DID change since Alpha 9

 * Bluetooth is back, now routed via the MiniUART, but the software stack is missing -- this means that our image doesn't stop someone using the bluetooth module independently if they put in a Pi0w, but we've not using space for the software.
 * FileSystem is now READ ONLY - use the nextpi-admin_* tools to manage this
 * nextpi-* tools are overridable via RAM, or persistent via the internal user persistence 
 * Dedicated /ram volatile drive exposed for NextPi use -- will be wiped every reboot
 * I2S Sound(!!) - PWM sound now disabled, swapped for new DAC, managed via DTO
 * SUPervisor reflects FS admin status - SUP> is RO, SUP# is RW
 * .bashrc for root, and SUPervisor now includes nextpi-* for default, persistent, and temp

-Xalior, 14 Sept 2019

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 8 of DietPi for Next

Probably the last "Rasbian Stretch" release.
First *EXPERIMENTAL* support for Pi Zero W - trades Bluetooth for Compatability
