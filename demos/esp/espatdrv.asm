; * (c) 2018 Infinite Imaginations / T.J.Gilberts			    *
; ***************************************************************************
;
; File version Alpha 07
;
; This file is the 512-byte NextOS driver itself, plus relocation table.
;
; Assemble with: pasmo espatdrv.asm espatdrv.bin espatdrv.sym
;
; After this, espatdrv_drv.asm needs to be built to generate the actual
; driver file.
;
; At the moment it requires a 16K page of memory available to bank to
; mmu5 and mmu7 pages before calling setup as part of the open
; this will eventually form part of the install process. This contains the
; Memory Resident TSR code and the command / write buffers.
;
; A000 is the 8K Page of assembly with the JUMP tables - this will move
; to MMC memory especially IF we implement a Spectranet compatible Sockets API
;
; This now replaces the UART driver to improve handling of received IPD packets
; so that they are placed directly on the relevent receive queues.
;
; This will also allow us to support the remote debugging service if a listener
; is setup within this code.

; Drivers are a fixed length of 512 bytes (although can have external 8K
; banks allocated to them if required).
;
; They are always assembled at origin $0000 and relocated at installation time
;
; The driver always runs with interrupts disabled, and may use any of the
; standard register set (AF,BC,DE,HL). Index registers and alternates must be
; preserved.
;
; No esxDOS hooks or restarts may be used. However, 3 calls are provided
; which drivers may use:
;
;       call    $2000   ; drv_drvswapmmc
;                       ; Used for switching between allocated DivMMC banks
;
;       call    $2003   ; drv_drvrtc
;                       ; Query the RTC. Returns BC=date, DE=time (as M_DATE)
;
;       call    $2006   ; drv_drvapi
;                       ; Access other drivers. Same parameters as M_DRVAPI.
;
; The stack is always located below $4000, so if ZX banks have been allocated
; they may be paged in at any location (MMU2..MMU7). However, when switching
; to other allocated DivMMC banks, the stack cannot be used unless you set
; it up/restore it yourself.
; If you do switch any banks, don't forget to restore the previous MMU setting
; afterwards.

TX_CHKREADY	EQU	4923	;133Bh Write is byte to send, when read status
